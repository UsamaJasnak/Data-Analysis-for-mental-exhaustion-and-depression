# Data-Analysis-for-mental-exhaustion-and-depression

Nowadays, Mental exhaustion and depression among medical students stand as a formidable challenge. This project explores the intricate relationships between empathy, mental health, and burnout among medical students, utilizing a cross-sectional dataset comprising of 887 medical students from the University of Lausanne from a study published in a medical journal in 2022 by Carrard et al. The project focuses on how variables such as age, gender, academic year, mental health, empathy, and burnout relate to depression (CES-D) and emotional exhaustion (MBI-Ex). The analysis involves using generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized additive models (GAMs) to capture the relation among the explanatory and response variables. Key findings suggest a notable decrease in emotional exhaustion and depression symptoms with few variables. The study provides valuable insights into the mental health challenges faced by medical students.
